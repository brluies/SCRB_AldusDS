vnderstande (ymagynacyon) The whiche is ser=

vndersta[n]de (Sensualyte) y[hat] whiche is seruaunt to

we pray/ so many sere fantasyes of ydle and euyll

we may by our myghtes dryue them awaye/ and
thus it is well proued that Bala is a foule Jange

yet sleke her thryst / the srynke that she desyreth is 
the lust of flesshly kyndelynesse and worldely dely

she thynketh/ for why/ for to fyll the appetyte of the
sensualyte/ all this worlde may not suffyse it. And
therefore it is that often tymes when we praye or
thynke on god & ghostly thynges we wolde fayne

Capitulu[n]					Primu[m]

The fyrste chylde that LYa conceyued
of Jacob/ is Ruben/ y[that] is drede/ and
therfore it is wrytenn the psalme.
The begynnynge of wysdome is y[the]
drede of our lorde. This is the fyrste
feled vertue in a mannes affeccyon/ without the
whiche none other may be had. And therfore who
so desyreth to haue suche a sone/ hym mehoueth bu
sely and often to beholde the euyll y[that] he hath done
And he shall on another partye thynke on y[the] grete
nesse of his gylte. And on another partye y[the] power
of the domesman/ and hyghe Juge. for of suche a 
co[n]syderacyon spryngeth drede y[that] is to say (Ruben)
that thorowe ryght is called the sone of syght. for
utterly he is blynde that seeth not the paynes that
are to come and dredeth not to synne. And well is
this (Ruben) called the sone of syght. for when he
was borne his moder cryed and sayd/ god hathe
sene my mekenesse. And mannes soule in suche a 
consyderacyon of his olde synnes & of the domes=
mannes or hyghe Juges power begynneth than
truly to se god by felynge of drede/ and also to be
sene of god rewardynge of pyte.

	ℂHow sorowe ryeth in the Affeccyon.
	Capitulu[m].		       Secundu[m]

Pg 4 V

Whyle Ruben wareth Symeon is bor
ne. for after drede/ it nedeth gretely
that sorowe come soone/ for euer the
more a man dredeth y[the] payne that he
hath deserued/ y[the] bytterlyer he sorow=
eth the synnes that he hathe done. Lya in the byr=
the of Symeon cryed & sayed. Our lorde hath her=
de me be had in dyspyte. And therefore is Symeon
called herynge. for a man when he bytterly soro=
weth he to be herde of god. And also for to here the
blessyd sentence of goddes owne mouthe. Blessyd
be they that soroweth/ for they shall be comforted
for in what houre the synner soroweth and tour
neth from his synne she shall be saufe/ thus wytnes
seth holy scrypture. And also by Ruben he is me=
ked and by Symeon he is contryte & hathe com=
puncyon of teeres. But (as wytnesseth Daayd in
a psalme) herte contryte and meked god shall not
dyspyse and withoute doubte suche sorowe is true 
comforte of herte.

ℂHowe hope ryseth in the affeccyon. CA.		iij.

But I praye the what comforte maye be to
them y[that] truly dredeth & bytterly soroweth
for theyr synnes ought but true hope of forgyue=
nesse/ the whiche is the thyrde sone of Jacob that
is Leuy the whiche is called in the story a doynge 
to. for whan the fyrst.ij.chyldren drede & sorowe
are gyuen of god to a mannes soule w[ith]out doubte

PG 4 Recto
The thyrde is that hope shall not be delayede/. but
he shall be done to as the storye wytnesseth of Le=
uy that whan these.ij.bretherne.Ruben.and Sy
meon were gyuen to theyr moder Lya.this.Leuy
was done or added to. Take hede to this worde,
that he was done to and not gyuen. And therefore
it is sayed that a man shall not perfume of home of
forgyuenesse before the tyme that his herte be me
ked in drede and contryte in sorowe/ for without
thyse.ij. hope is preumpcyon/ and where these.ij.
are hope is done to/ and thus after sorowe come=
th soone conforte. (As Dauyd telleth in a psalme)
That after the gretenesse of my sorowe in my her
te (He saythe to our lorde) thy comforte hath giad
ded my soule. And therefore it is that y[that] holy ghoost
is called (Paraclitus) that is the comforte a soroe
full soule.

ℂHowe we loue ryseth in the affeccyon.Ca. 	iiij.

ERom nowe forthe begynneth a manere of
homlynesse for to growe bytwene god & a
manes soule. Also on another maner a kyndelyn=
ge of loue. In o moche y[that] ofte tymes he feleth hym
not onely vysyted of god and comforted in his co=
mynge/ bur often tymes also he feleth hym fylled
with an unspekable Ioye. This homlynesse and
this kynoelynge of loue fyrst feled Lya wha[n] after
that Leuy was borne she vryed with a grete voy=
ce and sayd. Nowe shal my house baude be coupled.

PG 6 Verso

to me. The true spouse of our soule is god/ and tha[n]
are we truly coupled tp hym whan we drawe ne
re hym by hope/ and sothfast loue & ryght as after
hope cometh loue/ so after leuy was Judas borne
the.iiij. sone of Lya. Lya in his byrthe cryed & sayd 
Nowe shal I shryue me to our lorde. And therfore
in the story is Judas called shryfte. Also mannes
soule in this degree of loue offereth it clerely to god
& layth. Nowe shall I shryue me to our lorde/ for
before this felynge of loue in a mannes soule/ all y[that]
he dothe is done  rather for awe or drede than for
loue but in this state a mannes soule feleth god so
swete/ mercyfull/ so good/ so courtoys/ so true/ &
so kynde/ so faythfull/ so louely/ and so homly that
he leueth nothynge in hymselfe/ be it myght wytte
knowynge or wyll/ that he ne offreth it clerely/ fre
ly/ and homely to hym. This shryfte or confessyon
is not all onely of synne but of y[that] goodnesse of god
Grete token of loue it is wha[n] a man telleth to god
that he is good. Of this shryfte speketh Dauyd in
the psalter full often tymes whan he sayth. Make
the it knowne to god/ for he is good. ℂ Loo nowe
we haue sayd of .iiij. sones of Lya. And after this
she lefte berynge of chyldren/ and so mannes soule
weneth that it suffyseth to it whan it feleth that it
loueth the true goodes of god. And so it is ynou=
ghe to saluacyon/ but not to perfeccyon. For it fal=
leth to a perfyte soule bothe to be enflambed with
the fyre of loue in the affeccyon. And also to be yllu
mynyd with the lyght of knowynge in [the] reason.

PG 6 Recto

Than whan Iudas was borne / that is to
saye loue and desyre/ of one sene and in vy=
syble true goodes rysynge and waxynge in a ma[n]=
nes affeccyon. Than coueyteth Rachel for to bere
chyldren/ that is to saye/ than coueyteth reason to
knowe thyse thynges that affeccyon feleth/ for as
it falleth to Lya the affeccyon/ for to loue/ so it fal=
leth to Rachel the reason/ for to knowe of Lya/ the
whiche is Affeccyon/ spryngeth ordynat and mea
sured felynges. And of Rachel whiche is reason/
spryngeth ryght connynge & clere vnderstandyn=
dynges. And euer the more that Iudas waxeth/ [that]
is to say Loue/ so moche the more desyreth Rachel
berynge of chyldren[n]/ that is to saye reason studyeth
after knowynge. But who is that [the] woteth not
howe harde it is & nerehande inpossyble to a flessh
ly soule/ and whiche is yet rude in ghostly studyes
for to ryse in knowynge  of vnseasable thynges/ &
for to et his eyes of contemplacyon in ghostly thyn
ges. for why/ a soule that is yet rue and fleshly
knoweth not but bodely thynges/ and nothynge
cometh yet to the mynde but feble or vysyble thyn
ges and neuerthelesse yet it loketh inwarde as it
maye. And that that it maye not se yet by ghostly
knowynge/ it thynketh by ymagynacyon. ℂAnd
also this is the cause why Rachyll had fyste

PG 7 Verso

or rather chyldren of her mayden/ than of herselfe.
And so it is that thoughe a mannes soule may not 
yet gete the lyght of the ghostly knowynge in the
reason yet it thynketh if swete for to holde [the] myn
de on god and on ghostly thynges in the ymagy=
nacyon. As by Rachel Reason. So by her mayde
Bala we vnderstande ymagynacyon. And therfo
re reason she weth that it is more profytable for to
thynke on ghostly thynges/ on what maner it be
in kyndelynge of our desyre with some fayre yma
gynacyon/ than it is for to thynke on vanytees &
dysceyuable thynges of the worlde. And therefore
of Bala were borne thyse.ij. Dan and Neptalym
Dan is to say/syght of paynes to come. And Nep
talym/ syght of Ioyes to come. These ij. chyldren
are full nedefull/ and full spedefull to a werkynge
soule. The one putteth downe euyll suggestyons
of synne. And that other rayseth vp our welthe in
werkynge of good thynges/ and in kyndelynge of
our desyre. for as it falleth to Dan to put downe
euyll suggestyons of synne by syght of paynes to
come/ so it falleth to that other broder Neptalym/
for to reyse vp our welthes in werkynge good/ &
in kyndelynge of holy desyres by syght of Ioyes
to come. And therefore holy men when they are sty
red to only vnlawfull thynges/ be it in rysynge of
only soule thought/ as ofte as they set by for theyr
mynde the paynes [that] are to come. And so they sieke
theyr temptacyon in the begynnynge/ or it ryse to
only soule delyte in theyr soule/ and as ofte as theyr
deuocyon and theyr lykynges in god and ghostly

PG 7 Recto

thynges seaseth & waxeth colde (as often tymes
in this lyfe it faileth for corcupcyon of the felsshe/
and manye other skylles) as often they set before 
theyr mynde the Ioy that is to come. And so they 
kyndell theyr wyll with holy desyres/ and destroy 
theyr temptaycyons in the begynnynge or it come
to only yrkynge or heuynesse of slouthe. And ther-
fore that with Dan we dampne vnlefull though
tes/ therfore it is well called in the story Dome or
Iugement. And also his fader Iacop sayd of hym
thus. Dan shal deme his folke. And also it is sayd 
in the story that whan Bala brought forth Dam/
Rachell than sayd thus/ our lorde hath demed me
that is to say/ our lorde hath euened me and made 
me equall to my syster Lya/ and thus sayth reason
whan the ymagynacyon hath gotten the syght of
paynes to come [that] our lorde hath euened her with
her syster affeccyon/ and she sayd thus for she had
the syght of paynes in her ymagynacyon / of the 
whiche she hadde drede and sorowe in her felynge
And than after came Neptalym. That is to saye
sught of Ioyes to come. And in his byrthe spake
Rachell and sayd. I am made lyke vnto my syster
Lya. And therfore is Neptalym in the story called
lykenesse. And thus sayth reason/ that she is lyke
to hr syster affeccyon. For there as she hadde ho=
pe and loue of Ioye to come in her felynge/ she ha=
th nowe gotten syght of Ioye to come in her yma
gynacyon. Iacob sayd of Neptalym that he was 
an herte sente out gyuynge speche of fayrehede/ so
it is that when we ymagyne of the Ioyes of heue[n]
						B.iij.

Page 8 Verso

we saye that there is fayre in heuen. for wonder=
fully kyndeleth Neptalym our soule with holy de
syre as ofte as we ymagyne of the worthynesse/ &
the beautye of the Ioyes of heuen.

	ℂHouwe abstnence and paycyence ryseth in the 
	  sensualyte. Ca.			vj.

w	han Lya sawe that Rachel her syster ma=

	of Bala her mayden/ she called for the her
mayden zelfa to out her housbande Iacob that
she myght make Ioye to her syster hauynge other
ij. basterdes goten of her mayden zelfa. And thus
is is semely in mannes soule for to be/ that from [the]
tyme [that] reason hathe refrayned the grete Janglyn
gr of ymagynacyon/ & hathe out her to be vnder=
lowte to god/ and so to make hr bere some fruyte 
in helpynge of her knowynge/ [the] rught so the affec
cyon refrayne the lust and the thyrste of the sensua

resome fruyte in helpynge of her felynge/ but what 
fruyte may she bere/ ought but [that] she lerne to lyue
temperately in easy thynges/ & pacyently in vnea
sy thynges. Thyse are they / the chyldren of zelfa.
Gad. and Aser Gad is abstynence. Aser is pacyen
ce. Gad is the sooner borne chylde/ and Aser is the 
latter/ fyrst it nedeth [that] we be attempered in our

Page 8 recto

outwarde dylease in strengthe of pacyence Thyse
are the chyldren of zelfa brought for the in soro we
for in abstynence & pacyence/ the sensualyte is pu
nysshed in the flesshe/ but [that] that is sorowe of [the] sen=
sualyte. And therfore it was [that] whan Gad was
borne Lya cryed and sayd (happely) And therefore 
Gad is called in the story (happynes) And so it is
well sayd that abstynence in the sensualyte is hap
pynesse in the affeccyon. for why/ euer the lesse [that]
the sensualyte is delyted in her lust to moreswet=
nesse feleth[the] affeccyon in her luste. Also after wha[n]
Aser was borne lya sayd/ this shal befor my blysse
& therfore was Aser called in the story blessyd &
it is wel sayd [that] pacyence in the sensualyte is blysse
in the affeccyon. for why/ euer the more dysease [that]
the sensualyte suffereth the more blessyd is [the] soule
in the affeccyon. And thus by abstynence & pacyen
ce we shall not onely vnderstande a temperaunce
in mete and drynke/ and sufferynge of outwarde
trybulacyon/ but also all maner of flesshly/ kynde=
ly/ and worldely delytes/ and all maner of dysease
bodely or ghostly within or without/ reasonably/
or vnreasonably/ [that] by ony of our. v. wyttes tour=
menteth or delyteth in the sensualyte. On this wy
se bereth sensualyte fruyte in helpe of affeccion her
lady. Moche peas and rest is in that soule that no 
ther is dronken in lust of the sensualyte/ nor grut=
cheth in the payne therof. The fyrst of thyse is go=
ten by Gad. and [that] latter by Aser. Here it is to wete
that fyrst was Rachels mayden put to [the] housban

de/ than the mayden of Lya/ and this is the skyll
why. for truly but yf the Ianglynge of ymagy=
nacyon / that is to saye in the rennynge of vayne
thoughtes / be fyrste refrayned / without doubte
the luste of the sensualyte maye not be attempered
And therfore who soo wyll abstayne hym frome
flesshely and worldely luste / hym behoueth fyrste
seldome or neuer thynke ony vayne thoughtes at

a man perfytely dyspyle the ease of the flesshe and
not drede the dysease/ but yf he before haue busely
beholden the medes and the tourmentes that are

cyte of our conscyence from all temptacyons. for
all twmptacyons eyther they ryse within by thou=

Thus whan the enemyes fleeth and [that] cyte 
  is peased/ than begynneth a man to proue
what that [the] peas of god is that passeth mannes

cheldren vnto this tyme that Gad and Asar were
borne of zelfa her mayden. for truly but if it be so
that man hath refrayned the lust and the payne of
the.v. wyttes in hs sensualyte by abstynence and
pacyence he shall neuer fele inwarde swetnesse &
true Ioye in god and ghostly thynges in the affec

Jacob sayd of Isakar that he was a stronge asse

ANd therfore it is [the] after Isakar . zabulon

here it is to wete that hatred of synne is neuer fel

this is the skyll. for or this tyme was neuer the

of the delayenge therof. And also when he feleth
that he maye not always last in the felynge of that
ghostly Ioy for the corrupcyon of the flesshe of the
whiche corrupcyon synne is the cause/ than he ry=
seth with a stronge felynge of hatred agaynst all
synne in all kynde of synne. This felynge tought
Dauyd vs to haue where he sayd in the Psalme.
(Be ye wrothe/ & wyll ye not synne) That is thus 
to meane/ be ye wrothe with [the] synne but not with
the kynde. for kynde to the dede but not to
the synne. And here it is to wete that this wrathe
& this hatred is not contrary to charyte. But cha=
ryte techeth howe it shall be had/ bothe in a man
hymselfe and in his euyn crysten/ for a man sholde
not hate synne so that he dystroyed his hynde/ but 
so that he dystroy [the] synne and [the] appetyte of synne
in his kynde. And as agaynst our euyn crysten we
ought to hate synne in hym/ and to love hym. And
of this hatred speketh Dauyd in the psalme whe=

And in another psalme he sayth. (That he had in 
hatred all wycked waye) Thus it it is well proued
[that] or zabulon was borne Iudas and Isakar were
bothe borne. for but yf a man haue had charyte &
ghostly Ioye in his fyrst felynge/ he may in no wy

Jsakar/ that is to saye ghostly felynge of Ioye in

ℂHere is another doctryne of this holy mayde [that]
whiche she vsed to saye to herselfe in edefyenge of
others.

Thou vyle and wretched creature arte thou 
worthy ony maner of comforte in this lyfe
why haste thou not mynde of thy synnes: what
supposest thou of thyselfe wretched synner/ Is it 
not ynoughe to the trowest thou not that thou arte
escaped by [the] mercy of out lorde from euerlastynge
dampnacyon therfore thou sholdest be well apay=

doubte/ and be comforted endlesy yf thou bere the
se paynes pacyently / whyder haste thou chosen to
serue our lorde onely for [the] comfor=
tes that thou shalte haue of hym in the blysse of he
uen. Therfore aryse vp nowe and cease neuer of
thy ghostly excercyse that thou haste vsed/ but ra=
ther ecrease to them more.
ℂHere is an answere by the whiche she had a fy=
nall vyctory of the fende after longe threttes of in
tollerable paynes.
I Haue chosen payne to my refresshynge and
therfore it is not harde to me to suffre them
but rather delectable for the loue of my sauyoure
as longe as it pleaseth his mageste that I shall
suffre them. 

ℂHere is a doctryne of the sayd vyrgyne howe
we sholde vse the grace of our lorde.

w	Ho coude vse [the] grace of our lorde he shol=
	de euer haue the vyctory of al thynges that
	falleth to hym. for as ofte (she sayd) as ony
newe thynge falleth to a man be it of prosperyte/
or aduersyte/ he sholde thynke in hymselfe thus.
Of this wyll I wynne somwhat. for he that can
do so shall soone be ryche in vertue.
ℂHere foloweth notable doctrynes of this holy
mayde taken of her sermone whiche she made to
her dyscyples before her passynge / & the fyrst was 
this.

euery creature what that euer he be / and than he
sholde stretche vp his soule to our lorde & our ma=

herte maye not holly be gyuen to go/ but yf he be
free from all other loue/ open and symple without
doublenesse/ and so she affermed of herselfe/ that it
was her pryncypall laboure and busynesse frome
her younge age vnto that tyme/ euer for to come to 
that perfeccyon. Also she sayd that she knewe wel
that to suche a state of perfecyon in the whiche al
the herte is gyuen to god / a soule maye not come 
perfytely without medyacyon of deuoute prayer/
and that that prayer be grounded of deuoute prayer/
that/ it come not for the and prosede by ony trust of
ony maner of vertue of hym that prayeth/ but al=

to gyue her to that excercyse of prayer. Soo for to 
wynne [the[ contynuall habyte of prayer/ for she dyde
se well that by prayer all vertues are encreased &
made myghty and stronge. And without prayer
they waxe feble & fayle/ wherfore she endused her
dycyples [that] they sholde busy them to prayer perse=

faythe she sawe clerely & conceyued in her soule [that]
what [that] euer befell to her or to ony others/ all come
th of god/ not for hate but for grete loue [that] he hathe
to his creatures/ & in this quycke fayth she concey
ued in herselfe a loue & a redynesse to obey as well 
to the preceptes of her soueraynes/ as to the com=
mau[n]dementes of god / euer thynkynge that theyr
preceptes sholde come from gos/ or for nede of her
selfe/ or elles for encreas of vertue in her soule/ and
she sayd for to gete & pourchace purete of soule/ it
were ryght necessary [that] a man kepte hymselfe from
all manere of Iudgementes of his meyghboures
dedes/ for in euery creature we sholde beholde one
ly the wyll of god/ and therfore she sayd that in no
wyse men sholde deme creatures. That is nother
dyspyse them by theyr dome nor condempne them
all be it [that] they se them do open synne before them/ 
but rather they sholde haue compassyon on them
& pray for them/ & dyspyse them not nor co[n]dempne
them. Also she sayd that she had grete hope & trust
in goddes prouydence/ for she sayd she knewe wel

they ben made ghoostly and clene without bytter

therfore clymbe vp by this tree/ as I sayd in [the] be=

(That is to the reuerent affeccyon/ [the] whiche euer
wyll be in the yf thou tynke hartely on the other

therto by ony thought. And sykerly this is it the 
whiche is so medefull as I sayd/ and euer the lon=

ony thought) And euer the oftener that it is done
sodaynly/ lustely/ lykyngely/ without meane/ the

ℂAnother skyll there is why I set this tree in thy

be so that god maye do what he wyll/ yet to myne
vnderstandynge it is impossyble ony ma[n] to attay

selfe for to woke within thy soule. And this is the
skyll why that I counsayle the to take thyse two
youthes before all others. for a man is a myn=
ged or a myxte thynge of two substaunces of bo=
dely and ghostly/ so it nedeth to haue two dyuers 
meanes to come to perfeccyon by. Syth so is that
bothe theyr substaunces shall be oned at the vp ry
synge at the laste daye in vndeedlynesse/ soo that
eyther substauce be reysed to parfeccyon in this
lyfe/ by a meane accordynge therto/ and that is dre
de to bodely substaunce/ and hope to ghostly. And 
thus it is full semely and accordynge to be/ as me

haue O ordeyned thy clymbynge by these.ij. thou=
